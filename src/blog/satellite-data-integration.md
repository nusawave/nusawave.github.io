## Integrating Satellite Data for Marine Forecasting

Modern satellites continuously observe the world’s oceans — capturing wave height, wind vectors, and temperature fields in near real-time.

By assimilating these datasets into physical ocean models, Nusawave improves forecast accuracy, particularly in regions with sparse in-situ observations.

### Satellite Sources
- **Sentinel-3 & Jason-3** for altimetry  
- **ASCAT** for wind scatterometry  
- **MODIS & VIIRS** for ocean color and temperature  

Combining these inputs enables more precise short-term marine condition predictions.
