## Forecasting for Offshore Wind Farms

Wind energy is one of the fastest-growing sectors in renewable power generation.  
Accurate meteorological forecasting is critical to ensure optimal turbine performance and operational safety.

### Nusawave’s Role
We couple numerical weather prediction with ocean wave models to provide:
- **Hourly wind resource assessment**
- **Wave-induced load estimation**
- **Forecast-driven operation planning**

This integration improves efficiency and reduces maintenance downtime for offshore wind farms.
