## Open Data for Coastal Management

Coastal zones are among the most dynamic and vulnerable environments on Earth.  
Access to open marine datasets empowers communities to manage these areas sustainably.

### Recommended Datasets
- **Copernicus Marine Service** – Ocean currents, temperature, salinity, and biogeochemistry  
- **NOAA WaveWatch III** – Global and regional wave models  
- **GEBCO** – High-resolution bathymetry  

Nusawave integrates these open sources into easy-to-use dashboards and forecast services for public and research use.
